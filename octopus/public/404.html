        Random wikipedia article: 

        Sentence boundary disambiguation (SBD), also known as sentence breaking, sentence 
        boundary detection, and sentence segmentation, is the problem in natural language 
        processing of deciding where sentences begin and end. Natural language processing 
        tools often require their input to be divided into sentences; however, sentence 
        boundary identification can be challenging due to the potential ambiguity of 
        punctuation marks. In written English, a period may indicate the end of a sentence, 
        or may denote an abbreviation, a decimal point, an ellipsis, or an email address, 
        among other possibilities. About 47% of the periods in the Wall Street Journal 
        corpus denote abbreviations.[1] Question marks and exclamation marks can be 
        similarly ambiguous due to use in emoticons, computer code, and slang.

        Some languages including Japanese and Chinese have unambiguous sentence-ending 
        markers.

        STRATEGIES
        The standard 'vanilla' approach to locate the end of a sentence:
            (a) If it's a period, it ends a sentence.
            (b) If the preceding token is in the hand-compiled list of 
                abbreviations, then it doesn't end a sentence.
            (c) If the next token is capitalized, then it ends a sentence.
        This strategy gets about 95% of sentences correct.[2] Things such as shortened 
        names, e.g. "D. H. Lawrence" (with whitespaces between the individual words that 
        form the full name), idiosyncratic orthographical spellings used for stylistic 
        purposes (often referring to a single concept, e.g. an entertainment product 
        title like ".hack//SIGN") and usage of non-standard punctuation (or non-standard 
        usage of punctuation) in a text often fall under the remaining 5%.

        Another approach is to automatically learn a set of rules from a set of documents 
        where the sentence breaks are pre-marked. Solutions have been based on a maximum 
        entropy model. The SATZ architecture uses a neural network to disambiguate 
        sentence boundaries and achieves 98.5% accuracy.
